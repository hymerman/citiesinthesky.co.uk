		<h2>About</h2>
		<p>Well, I've been promising to write a little bit about the game for a while, so I figured I may as well get it done now, before you lot lose interest! So, here goes... the game in brief:</p>
		<p>The best "like X but with Y" comparison I've heard so far, and the response I tend to get from people when I talk about the game, is "So it's like Tetris mixed with Sim City?". It's not a bad description, I suppose.</p>
		<p>Basically, you're a god (cliche, I know) responsible for building on this floating island. You're tasked with keeping the people happy. The people are happier when they have certain buildings, laid out in a certain way. Unfortunately, you can't just place things as you please, as you also have to balance the island - too many heavy buildings on one side and it could well tip and fall out of the sky. The buildings come one by one from the sky (there's the Tetris part), and you have to arrange them so as to keep the people happy and the island balanced (there's the Sim City part).</p>
		<p>There'll be interesting additions to this, of course - a little bit of physics thrown in will make falling buildings and the like pretty fun, and I'm quite looking forward to implementing natural disasters! Hopefully all this will be a stupendously large barrell of laughs and will cause orgasmic pleasure in anyone that plays the game. Or maybe it'll just be me that likes it, I don't know. We'll see!</p>
